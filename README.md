[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/sojohnnysaid/discord-utility-bot)](https://repl.it/github/sojohnnysaid/discord-utility-bot)

To get the bot running, type in the terminal:

npm install


This will install all the libraries we need.

then type:

node index.js

this will get the bot running. You should see it says "bot connected."

now you can go to the dev server in discord
and type !help me

if the bot responds you are running the bot from here!


to make development easier quit the bot by pressing ctrl c

then run this command:
nodemon index.js

now while you are coding, everytime you save
your file the bot will restart automatically, so you can test your changes on the discord server without having to type node index.js everytime you want to try something new.

Have fun!
